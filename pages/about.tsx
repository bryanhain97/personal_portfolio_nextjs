                            i grew up in the beautiful city of berlin in a district called treptow-k√∂penick. when i grew up, i loved playing video games and do sports. my first goal was to become a professional e-sports player for a game called <i className={colorMode === 'light' ? styles.cursiveColorLight : styles.cursiveColorDark}
                            >leagueoflegends</i>. i reached place 7 in europe with my team in 3 versus 3. i figured out a lot later, i&apos;ve always been a very competetive guy. when i was 17, i <i className={colorMode === 'light' ? styles.cursiveColorLight : styles.cursiveColorDark}>started boxing </i>because i was so inspired by mike tyson. back then, it was my biggest dream to become a professional boxer then. unfortunately i couldn&apos;t fulfill my dream because of injuries i sustained from boxing. at around 23 years of age, i figured that i&apos;ve got to look out for another career that i could pursue.
